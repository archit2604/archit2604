### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am Archit Rungta, I am a final year undergraduate student at BITS Pilani, India studying Electrical and Electronics Engineering. I am due to complete my undergraduate thesis in December 2022, which I am pursuing at the Biorobotics Lab, Robotics Institute, under Prof. Howie Choset on Multimodal Inspection and Adaptive Path Planning for Wire Arc Additive Manufacturing.

I am particularly interested in Motion Planning, Controls and Robot Vision.
